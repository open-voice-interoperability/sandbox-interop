1. in OVONIOparser.py had to remove "import dotenv" (part of your env settings?)
2. need to run "localhost" not (your ip?) http://10.0.0.218:8242/
	I put-> serviceAddress: "http://localhost:8242/" in the mgr.js file
3. The line:
	CORS(app, resources={r"/*": {"origins": "*"}})
   is different than what I use in my pythonanywhere, but good news this works
   fine on my machine. No CORS problem.
4. In sbSpeech.js:155&156 the === fails because v is a string from localstorage
   and not an integer. I changed it back. 
5. Messages sent from assistants should have schema also:
	schema: { "version": "0.9.0", "url": "not_published_yet" }
6. Dress up the logs e.g.
	a. use "lightColor" for panel under the corresponding log section
	b. in fullDialog mode show "human", "wizard", etc (not "browser")
	c. title the page with the convoID, date, etc.
7. Continue with the "voices" page e.g.
	a. make the "sample phrase box longer
	b. save that phrase to localstorage so it persists
	c. speak it on selection
	d. persist the selected TTS full name & index (until next select)
	e. drop down filter to show voices of one language
	f. persist one choice so that I can pick another and compare
	g. saving msg.volume=0-1,msg.rate=0.1-10,msg.pitch=0-2 values?

8. I think we need to impliment gitignore on a lot of the runtime/support files. (e.g. .pyc files)
