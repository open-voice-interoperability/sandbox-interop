Something I'd add on the readme for people who are not familiar with pip at the begin:
10:21
On Linux, run first sudo apt update. Then the command would be: sudo apt install python3-pip
On Mac, using brew, first brew install python3
Then brew postinstall python3
Try calling pip3 -V to see if it worked.
